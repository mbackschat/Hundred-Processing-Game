The aim of the game is simple: grow the balls to reach an overall size of 100 points by touching the balls with the mouse. Do not grow balls when they touch each other. Each ball can only grow to a certain extend (around 70 points), so you need to grow multiple balls.
You have 3 lives and you gain a bonus live after 3 levels.
The levels get more difficult by increasing the speed and the number of balls.

It runs under Processing as an Applet (Java) and in the Browser (Javascript).

The game is a remake of the "Hundreds" Flash game (http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/540694).
It uses Box2d and the Maxim audio library.
